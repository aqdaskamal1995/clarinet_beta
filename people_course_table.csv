Connie Wang,Introduction to Data Science ,"Data Science 1 is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year."
Connie Wang,Urban Economics,"This course introduces economic frameworks for understanding both the benefits and challenges of living in, working in and managing cities.  Urban economics incorporates the concept of space into canonical economic models and provides a lens for analyzing and describing the nature and organization of economic activity in urban settings.  We will explore questions around why cities exist in the first place, what determines their growth, and what features contribute to their economic advantages as well as their unique problems.  Why do some cities grow faster than others?  Can cities ever get too dense or large?  We will draw from typical urban economic models and frameworks, but will also discuss and test their limits when applying them to complex urban systems. For example, how well do these models address issues of segregation and informality in cities?  The course will draw from research and scholarship in the field of urban economics, as well as actual cases, policy applications and guest lecturers employing these concepts in the field.  Students who take this class will be able to use economic frameworks and methods to design, evaluate and implement planning and policy interventions in a range of urban settings.  "
Connie Wang,City Use of Technology,This three-credit course surveys the efforts of city officials around the world as they use technology to solve challenging problems and act to both keep pace with technological innovations and safeguard the public interest. This survey course is designed to equip students with an overview of tools they will need to grapple with urban and civic challenges post-graduation. Students will examine and report on ongoing civic projects.
Connie Wang,Urbanization and Development,"This course examines the relationship between urbanization and development through an historical and contemporary lens, paying close attention to the ways that the growth and structure of cities in the late-industrializing world has influenced the economic, social, and political prospects of residents and their host nations, as well as vice-versa. Students will learn how to interrogate and deconstruct the assumed relationships between urbanization and economic development. Although the latter is frequently understood as employment and prosperity conditions driven by market and investment dynamics at territorial scales that both include and transcend the city, students will also be encouraged to think about ""de-growth"" strategies and the politics underlaying the emergence of this discourse. Students will become versed with the inter-relationships between urban growth and national or global economic priorities, on one hand, and the connections between cities and their surrounding regions on the other. They will then be asked to consider the implications of these relationships for equity, inclusion, ecological sustainability, and social as well as environmental justice, with the aim of identifying potential actions to advance these aims. In addition, we highlight the social and economic exigencies of citizens in the face of these relationships, examining their capacities to accommodate, modify, or reject the priorities, projects, and policies imposed by planners, designers, governing authorities, investors or other capitalists, and multilateral development agencies with specific urban development agendas. Readings draw primarily from Latin America, South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East, although on occasion evidence from Europe and the United States is used for contrast."
Connie Wang,Innovation and Rennovation,"The course is appropriate for students anticipating a career in which sensing opportunity for new products/services/business models and successfully bringing those ideas to market are key activities. That’s the “innovation” part of the course title. A key feature of the course is that it also addresses “renovation” of the product line over time. New products are added at established price points, e.g. the horizontal Coca-Cola product line extension with Coke Zero. Or, an existing category is expanded by “trading up” (a higher priced/performance item added, e.g. an iPod with greater storage capacity) or “trading down” (a lower price/performance item added – e.g. Titleist “Tour Speed” golf balls to hit the $40 price point – as compared to the top-of-the-line $50 ball.) The course will cover a wide variety of contexts and thus be useful for those starting their own companies or joining an established organization."
Connie Wang,Private Capital for Public Purpose,"This module will introduce and critically analyze efforts to direct private sector financial investments to public purpose. These efforts-falling under the headings of impact, responsible, mission, social, and sustainable investing-looks for ways to maximize the social utility of private investment. We will examine the: 1) types of investors engaged in these efforts (e.g. individuals, pension funds, endowments, foundations); 2) social goals they hope to achieve through their investments; 3) investment strategies and vehicles through which they hope to achieve these goals; 4) intersections of impact investing and public policy; 5) ways that stakeholders assess the impact of these investments. The class will balance U.S. domestic and global examples of investment, policymaking, and advocacy."

The class will balance U.S. domestic and global examples of investment, policymaking, and advocacy."
Austin Ledzian,Tough Tech Ventures,"Tough tech ventures face both high levels of technology and commercial pathway uncertainty, and therefore demand their own strategies and tactics for managing risk vs. reward. Historically, most entrepreneurship courses (at HBS, and elsewhere) disproportionately focus on consumer- and /or software-centric business model and product experimentation tools (e.g., business model canvas, Lean Startup methodology) which are optimized for venture opportunities with relatively low technological and/or market uncertainty.

While tough technology has the potential to transform incumbent industries and tackle our most pressing societal issues, the tough tech ventures which design and deploy these solutions confront a number of challenges that are distinct from those faced by more mainstream startups. This course has been built from the ground up to dig deeply into these challenges and to provide impactful and actionable frameworks which build on all the tools learned so far at HBS to overcome them in order to drive impact at scale.

"
Austin Ledzian,Abstraction and Design in Computation,"Fundamental concepts in the design of computer programs, emphasizing the crucial role of abstraction. The goal of the course is to give students insight into the difference between programming and programming well. To emphasize the differing approaches to expressing programming solutions, you will learn to program in a variety of paradigms -- including functional, imperative, and object-oriented. Important ideas from software engineering and models of computation will inform these different views of programming."
Austin Ledzian,Field Y,"The course is designed to enable students to develop and grow their businesses. Doing so while on campus has several advantages, including access to resources (faculty time and attention, library and computer access); advice from your peers in a structured environment; and devoted blocks of time during your EC year to move your business forward while your team is all in one location. The course employs a combination of field methods, classroom exercises, cross-team interactions, and access to faculty, guest experts, and other advisors. The largest single allocation of time is for working with your team to make meaningful progress on your own business.

Several dozen teams from last year are running their businesses full-time now, most of whom have received funding of $500,000 or more; in some cases far more."
Austin Ledzian,Making the American City,"This course examines major episodes in the history of American urban growth, design, and planning to understand the urgent social, environmental, and development issues of today.  It traces the growth and elaboration of North American cities in four major periods of urban history from the early European settlement to the present, with an emphasis on the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Through the study of plans, physical projects, and material conditions, Making the American City investigates specific topics, such as the downtown; homes and housing; public parks and landscapes; planned communities and civic spaces; homes and housing; transportation systems; environmental threats and disasters; the provision of infrastructure; racial and ethnic settlement patterns; slums and ghettos; bohemias and art districts; urban renewal and revitalization; gentrification; public landscapes and spaces; and suburbia in all its diversity.The objective of the course is to use history to inform the thinking and practice of contemporary designers, planners, and policy makers. Students enrolled in the course will gain a fundamental knowledge of the major events that have contributed to the form and character of modern American cities. The format of the course will be lectures and class discussions. The method of evaluation will be short student papers on projects or subjects chosen from different periods of the history of the American city.  There are no prerequisites."
Austin Ledzian,Building and Urban Conservation,"What are the values inherent in a property, site or district that must be understood to craft conservation policy and interventions that will reveal, complement, sustain and enhance the original work while appropriately addressing socio-cultural, aesthetic and technical integrity?  This course will introduce students to the functional, technical, regulatory and environmental principles of working with existing buildings and districts to ensure their continued viability.   Globally, 35% or more of construction activity is devoted to work on existing structures – making the sustainability mantra “the greenest building is the one already built” increasingly relevant as we seek to minimize the impact of construction on the environment. Repair and renewal are therefore fundamental components of contemporary practice increasingly requiring facility in techniques of conservation planning and execution, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse.  Designed to ground the participant in the methodologies of conservation and renewal and to introduce the tools necessary to successfully approach working with existing buildings in established precincts, the course will include lectures by the instructor and guest experts, and in-class discussions from readings.  While interventions must include sound technical solutions, any modification from conservation to renovation and additions must address the full complement of values necessary to enable an economically viable, socio-culturally relevant rehabilitation. We will examine a range of conservation and intervention case studies at the building and urban scale for both traditional and modern structures and sites – including a mini-module on the impending renovations to Gund Hall.We will look critically at how the international Charters and Standards employed in working with historic fabric impact our approach to modifications to any existing building or site from a technical, design and regulatory standpoint, and will particularly address the question as to how the apparatus of conservation is changing to best serve both underrepresented constituencies and the legacy of modernism and the recent past.The course is a lecture and discussion-based seminar.  Evaluation will be based upon participation in readings and themed discussion, submission of a short analytical mid-term paper, and a choice of final project: either 1., an assessment and intervention design exercise on an undeveloped modest property, or 2., an analytical case study of the rehabilitation and transformation of a significant property – either of the student’s choosing."
Austin Ledzian,Research Topics in HCI,"Students will read and discuss systems HCI papers, i.e., papers published in human-computer interaction and related venues that build and evaluate novel systems, with a focus on systems that work especially well with (or clash against) human cognitive capabilities. Activities will also include lectures on key topics relevant to building and testing systems in HCI. As a final project, students will implement and evaluate components of one or more selected papers and present their findings in writing and orally in a conference-style format, as means to understand more deeply the processes behind systems HCI research."
Dishi Gautam,CS50,"Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before."
Dishi Gautam,Elements of the Urban Stack,"The Urban Stack is a pedagogical framework for understanding the infrastructures of power that operate in relationship to practice. These constructs shape the design and production of the built environment in our time of increasing uncertainty, project complexity, and risk. The course is designed to explore, translate and generate alternative readings of our built context; to imagine how design and planning practice can shape the environmental, social, cultural, and experiential qualities of urban form within our emerging 21st century context. A primary objective of the course is to identify gaps and opportunities in the layered socio-technical systems that guide the production of the built environment; to enable culturally and socially transformative development with the goal of practical application in the real world.This course addresses the practice of design as it inevitably confronts and interacts with infrastructures of policy, technology, and finance. Theoretical frameworks will help us seek space for design impact and agency through established and emerging modes of practice and projects that operate upon, within, or against these systemic constructs. Our task is to collectively answer the following questions: As urban projects grow in complexity, swelling and speeding up to attain maximum impact, is our work inevitably defined and shaped by the pressures of finance, automation, and regulation? Where does our agency as designers of the built environment lie in current practice?"
Dishi Gautam,The Idea of Environment,"The environment is the milieu in which designers and planners operate. It is a messy world of facts, meanings, relations, and actions that calls them to intervene—that is, to make a plan, solve a problem, create a product, or strategize a process. They use various measures to assess and project their interventions from beauty and efficiency to systems and sustainability. Today, increasing volatility and uncertainty of the environment, however, alongside a growing sense and presence of crises and disasters, compels us to reconsider how we have imaged and imagined, defended and critiqued, planned and designed the environment. The class will explore how and what new approaches to representation, visualization, and measurement might lead to different relations in a changing world.  This class is a seminar focused on reading and discussion. Course participants will be required to submit weekly reading responses, to contribute to discussions online and in class, and to develop an original research and/or design project over the course of the semester."
Dishi Gautam,Drawing for Designers,"The course is intended as a creative drawing laboratory for designers and an expressive, playful supplement to computer-based labor.This course will master techniques in hand drawing, refining sensitivity to all details of what one sees and developing capacity to articulate it in a visually convincing and evocative form.The class projects will include work in outdoor and indoor situations and places as well as drawings of live models. In the process of drawing, students will focus on the world of lines, textures, shapes, light, shade, and values. We will use various tools, materials, and artistic techniques including pencils, vine charcoal, markers, ink, and other wet and dry media, later combined with the use of camera, computer renderings, etc.Throughout the duration of the course, students will complete three larger drawing projects and special short assignments.In one nonrepresentational drawing project, students will focus on the formal articulation of emotional life experience. In another project, we will explore the performance of the human body in interaction with elements of the architectural environment. In a final project, the drawing exploration of the bodily interaction with the architectural environment as well as the site-specific wall drawing exercise will be conducted in the interior places inspired by and creatively responding to the existential and spatial conditions imposed by the quarantine and the epidemics.In addition, students will make individual self-guided field trips to sketch and draw in the outdoor environment and then complete their work in the places they live.Work on projects will be supplemented by presentations and discussions of relevant examples from art history and contemporary art. Guest artists will be invited as reviewers for the presentation and exhibition of final projects."
Dishi Gautam,Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"This course will explore the complex relationships between scientific advances, technological innovations, manufacturing technologies, and the development and evolution of an industry. While many students may already be familiar with scientific research and technological innovations, this course will explore how advances in science and technology impact manufacturing, industry architecture, and business. Some basic background in business management and government will be reviewed including manufacturing processes, business strategy, disruptive innovation, intellectual property, industry standards, and political economy to provide proper context for understanding the practical implications of technological innovations. We will review and investigate the basic scientific phenomena and technological innovations that underpin some major industries such as Steel, Automobiles, Semiconductors and Personal Computers. By reviewing the historical evolution of these technologies and the corresponding economic, political, legal, and sociological circumstances, we will develop a framework for understanding the strategic forces that disrupt businesses and create entrepreneurial opportunities and reshape industry structures. Working together in small groups, students will be assigned a term project to research and analyze the strategic forces that shaped other major industries such as Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Communications, and Textile/Clothing."
Dishi Gautam,Designing with Light,"This hands-on course serves as a foundation in the art and craft of creative lighting design. Students will explore the medium of light itself and its possibilities in storytelling and world-creation. Introductory exercises in perception and psychology will lead to intensive experimentation with various sources of light to create 2D images or 3D environments. Composition, form, color, time and movement will be explored, as well as the basics of lighting technology. Lighting Design has numerous applications and dimensions, and developing a degree of mastery with light as a medium is useful across many fields. While theatrical lighting equipment will be used in the course, and there will be some emphasis on lighting design for performance, our focus will not be exclusively centered around design for the stage."
Dishi Gautam,Paper or Plastic,"We tend to assume that supermarkets are static, neutral spaces where little of significance ever happens. The supermarket shelf is actually a highly volatile, hyper-competitive dynamic market landscape. On this shelf, products struggle to maximize every possible advantage, all in a ruthless effort to lure consumers away from competitors. However, what may have once been merely an issue of attention-grabbing graphics applied to packaging has quickly become much more complex. The contemporary consumer in today’s strained economy demands tangible value from the products that he/she consumes. To survive, brands must wrestle with new issues that include the ergonomics of the hand, the complex geometries of the refrigerator, and even sustainable material innovations that determine a product’s afterlife and its impact on the environment. These are multi-scalar, spatial life problems that designers are uniquely suited to address.This seminar will ask students to operate as brand strategists. However, rather than invent new products, students will instead innovate upon existing brands. Outdated supermarket products will be reconsidered from the top down (brand identity, consumer target, logo, tagline, packaging, etc.). Students will also be required to study their product’s shelf competitors and will learn by presenting their observations through visual arguments rather than those that are explicitly verbal.Each seminar will open with multimedia presentations on topics such as conducting demographic research, global color psychology, brand architecture, case studies in product launch failures, creating brand touchpoints, crafting a visual argument, and making an effective pitch. These conversations will be supplemented by readings from the business and financial sections of several newspapers, magazine articles, and blog interviews with brand experts.The deliverables for the seminar will be presented in final review format in front of a cross-disciplinary jury of business luminaries. The output will include a full-scale 3-D print of the product redesign supplemented by graphical data, renderings, and digital animations. Ultimately, the seminar’s ambition is to make real a scenario that finds designers sitting at multiple tables, tackling issues of economics, technology, politics, and media at macro and micro scales."
Ana Merla,Visualization,"An introduction to key design principles and techniques for visualizing data. Covers design practices, data and image models, visual perception, interaction principles, visualization tools, and applications. Introduces programming of web-based interactive visualizations."
Ana Merla,Nano Micro Macro,"This course is an interdisciplinary platform for designers, engineers, and scientists to interact and develop innovative new products. The course introduces ideas-to-innovation processes in a hands-on, project/product focused manner that balance design and engineering concepts with promising, real-world opportunities. Switching back and forth between guided discovery and focused development, between bottom-up and top-down thinking, and market analyses, the course helps students establish generalizable frameworks as researchers and innovators with a focus on new and emerging technologies. There are no prerequisites."
Ana Merla,Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"This course will explore the complex relationships between scientific advances, technological innovations, manufacturing technologies, and the development and evolution of an industry. While many students may already be familiar with scientific research and technological innovations, this course will explore how advances in science and technology impact manufacturing, industry architecture, and business. Some basic background in business management and government will be reviewed including manufacturing processes, business strategy, disruptive innovation, intellectual property, industry standards, and political economy to provide proper context for understanding the practical implications of technological innovations.

Working together in small groups, students will be assigned a term project to research and analyze the strategic forces that shaped other major industries such as Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Communications, and Textile/Clothing."
Ana Merla,Science of Behavior Change                                                                                        ,"Psychologists and economists have joined forces to study how people process information and actually make decisions, rather than how they would make decisions if they were fully rational and selfish.  This research program (behavioral economics, judgment and decision making, or behavioral science) shows how decisions deviate from “optimal” and why it matters.  We explore the nature, causes, implications and applications of these limitations.  The course’s main focus is on how these tendencies can inform the design and development of welfare-enhancing interventions.The Science of Behavior Change (MLD 304) has one central objective: to improve students’ abilities to design policies and interventions that improve societal well-being.  It accomplishes this by focusing on how to leverage insights about human decision making to develop interventions (“nudges”).  We piece add to the toolbox that standard economics provides for influencing behavior (namely, incentives and information) with the insights from behavioral science. There are three additional, though secondary, goals for this class.  First, it will help you better understand the science of how humans make judgments and decisions.  We will review research on human thinking from social psychology, cognitive psychology, political science, organizational behavior, decision science, and economics (including its subfield, behavioral economics). Second, this course aims to improve the quality of your own judgments and decisions.  People are poor intuitive statisticians, meaning that when they “just think” about situations for which some data or casual observations exist, they tend to make serious inferential errors, in turn leading to systematically biased decisions. We will study some errors that are particularly important for real world problems and look for easy‐to‐implement solutions. Third, this course aims to increase your familiarity with randomized experiments so you can be a smarter consumer of claims that interventions cause certain outcomes.  The class will be suffused with randomized experiments and we will repeatedly discuss how confident one can be that intervention X causes outcome Y. Applications of the material covered in this course include policy design, healthcare, diversity and inclusion, energy, politics, education, finance, negotiation, risk management, human resource management, and organization of teams, among others."
Ana Merla,Offsite/Onsite,"Today, everybody is a curator—we supposedly curate our meals, our social media feeds, and our outfits. But what does it mean to curate exhibitions of contemporary art today? This course examines the working processes of organizing exhibitions within the field of contemporary visual arts and the context of both art institutions, such as museums, and outside of museums.  This course examines the theoretical and practical considerations of curating “offsite” and “onsite.” We will examine the frameworks around both of those sites and formats, such as responding to a site’s history or working with artists on site-specific commissions. The aim is to familiarize students with various aspects of exhibition-making ranging from conceptual development to the physical realization of exhibitions. This course introduces and engages students in a broad spectrum of exhibition presentations and institutional contexts, with a focus on different exhibition typologies of “offsite” and “onsite,” ideas of audience engagement, curatorial responsibility, working with artists, questions of history and the contemporary moment, and risk-taking.This course will be organized around case studies of major exhibitions organized by both Eva Respini and Dan Byers at a broad range of institutions including the ICA/Boston, Venice Biennale, Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, as well as those curated by select guest lecturers. Many class sessions will involve visits to nearby museums and galleries and other “offsite” venues.  Through readings and discussion, viewing assignments, and guest lectures, we will critically analyze the role of curators and art institutions, and examine the ways contemporary art and its reception in exhibition engages with broader social, cultural, and political issues.Throughout the semester, students will develop ideas and parameters for an exhibition, culminating in a final presentation that will include a proposal, preliminary list of artists, an exhibition design, and work plan. Instructors will alternate teaching classes, with a few key sessions taught together."
Ana Merla,Geographical Representation and Positionality,"Maps both represent reality and create it. It is in the context of this contention that this course presents the fundamentals of mapping, spatial analysis, and visualization. In a design process, the act of mapping selectively narrates site conditions. By choosing what features, forces, and flows to highlight---and which to exclude-the designer creates the reality in which their intervention will be situated. This is only becoming more true, as urban space and populations are ever-more pervasively measured, monitored, and categorized by innumerable institutions. Such representations are often a designer's primary means of responding to a site. Designers are in the difficult position of approaching spatial datasets critically and as sites of contestation while also employing them in their work: propositionally, descriptively, and narratively.Over the course of a semester, students will work extensively with techniques of spatial analysis. Using desktop GIS software, we will explore data sources, data models, overlays, map algebra, spatial statistics, terrain analysis, and suitability modeling, among other techniques of spatial representation. Students will learn to embed these techniques within larger design workflows."
Ana Merla,Nonprofit Management and Leadership,"This course is designed to prepare HKS students to work in the nonprofit sector as managers, and ultimately, as leaders. It is appropriate for students with interests across the sector, from social services, to international aid, to the arts. The objective is to give students a basic background in organizational structure, social enterprise, resources, communications, and business planning. Both intellectual foundations and practical management strategies will be covered.This class will focus exclusively on nonprofit management, and will not cover lobbying or political activism."
Ana Merla,Authenticity MIT Prison Initiative,"Explores the question of how to live an authentic life, through works of western and eastern philosophy and contemporary psychology. Topics include emotions, anger, honesty, forgiveness, non-violent communication, conflict resolution, kindness and cruelty and compassion. Taught inside a secure Massachusetts correctional facility with a mix of MIT students and incarcerated students."
Ana Merla,"Extended Cognition: Designing for Embodied, Spatial, and Social Thinking",
Ana Merla,Feminist Data Ethics,"Considers the ethical implications of new technologies and their impact on how we receive and transmit various types of data: medical, genetic, financial, personal. Data is being generated in many ways from our physical bodies, and this form of ""datafication"" has far-reaching ethical implications, particularly for historically marginalized and/or oppressed bodies, which are often subject to sexual objectification, surveillance, and other forms of control."
Cedric-Pascal Sommer,BE 121: Cellular Engineering,"This is a combined introductory graduate/upper-level undergraduate course that focuses on examining modern techniques for manipulating cellular behavior and the application of these techniques to problems in the biomedical and biotechnological arenas. Applications in drug discovery, regenerative medicine, and cellular agriculture will be discussed. Topics will include controlling behavior of cells through cell-matrix interactions, cytoskeletal architecture, and cell behavior in processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing. Lectures will review fundamental concepts in cell biology before delving into topical examples from current literature. Students will work weekly in the lab learning cell culture techniques, soft lithography, microscopy, and classical in vitro assays measuring cell behavior"
Cedric-Pascal Sommer,SCI6481: Ecosystem Restoration,"Given the current speed of habitat and species loss caused by human development, the restoration of degraded ecosystem is one of the greatest challenges humankind is facing. For this reason, the United Nations declared the current decade (2021-2030) as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. This global effort will need from experts on ecosystem science, management and design to have a deep understanding of how ecosystems recover from human disturbance and how we can use this knowledge to increase the currently limited performance of restoration practice. This course is particularly suited for students with interests in nature conservation, the natural component of landscape architecture, or ecosystem management in a broad sense. This course is cross-listed with the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, which will allow students from both disciplines to exchange their knowledge in a multidirectional learning environment where we all will address real world restoration cases. In this year’s edition, we will focus on the restoration of New England’s ecosystems. We will work in parallel to an ongoing research project to understand the recovery of New England’s ecosystem over the last 300 years since the abandonment of most of the farms created by the original settlers. Through research, we will learn how forests and other ecosystems have changed during this time to apply that knowledge to a real restoration project that students will develop. We will have key inputs from guest lectures coming from restoration companies with many years of experience restoring ecosystems worldwide. They will help us find targeted tools to support and design ecosystems both in urban and natural environments in the New England context. We will increase our understanding of what nature is for humans and the Earth system and will increase our connection to it through self-guided field trips. At least, one previous course in ecology or a similar topic is required. This course will arm you with one of the most important tools to work with and for nature in the coming decades."
Cedric-Pascal Sommer,COMPSCI 109B: Data Science 2,"Data Science 2 is the second half of a one-year introduction to data science. Building upon the material in Data Science 1, the course introduces advanced methods for statistical modeling, representation, and prediction. Topics include  multiple deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, transformers, language models, autoencoders, and generative models as well as basic Bayesian methods, and unsupervised learning. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year. Part two of a two-part series."
Cedric-Pascal Sommer,SCI6317: Material Systems: Digital Design,"Digital design and fabrication technologies have become integral to the discourse surrounding contemporary design and architectural practice. The translation from design to realization is mediated by a range of tools and processes whose development is informed over time by material properties, skill, technology, and culture. As a whole, these systems are the vehicle by which design teams, manufacturers, installers, and ultimately users engage the materiality of architecture. Parallel technological developments relating to the way in which things are designed (digital modeling, simulation, generative design, etc.) and the way things are made (automation, computer-controlled equipment including robotics, advanced materials, etc.) have afforded new opportunities and challenges related to the realization of new forms in architecture, part customization, user-centered design, and enhanced building performance.

Within this context, this year’s course positions ceramic material systems as a vehicle for exploring applied research methodologies and investigation into the opportunities (and challenges) afforded by digital fabrication techniques. Building on nearly a decade of research by the Material Processes and Systems (MaP+S) group at the GSD and long-time collaboration with the Harvard Ceramics Studio in Allston (with Kathy King), this course will advance strategies for robotics, additive manufacturing, and other computational fabrication technologies. Ceramics are the first material created by humankind and are produced across scales and applications from the craft studio to high-volume, automated manufacturing environments. Easily manipulated by hand, it can just as easily be subject to digital technologies and robotic approaches. While ceramic-specific aspects of material design and manipulation will be taught, emphasis is on understanding ceramics as a microcosm of material research that offers insights that transfer to work with almost any material used in architecture.

The course includes weekly lectures (including guests from related industries and practice), discussions, and hands-on workshops. Lectures include a historic overview of material systems, fundamentals of fabrication and manufacturing, strategic customization, digital and physical prototyping, digital simulation, introduction to robotic systems, introduction to product development, production economics, research methods, and other topics. Selected readings of book chapters and papers will supplement topics taught in class. Technical workshops will introduce core concepts in machine design, microelectronics, motion control, kinematics, and material processes. Students will be introduced to a range of digital fabrication and robotic systems, and their related software environments and digital techniques.

The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year."
Hana Yamaki,Product management and society: building technology in the the public interest ,"Intended for those interested in understanding the critical role of a product manager to build technology services in the public sector or in mission focused private sector.  All levels of product management experience welcomed; no experience in software, product management, or design necessary.Delivering critical services to the public requires building technology that works for people and for society. In environments like the public, non-profit, and mission-oriented private sectors, this is can be a challenge, but it is possible and necessary to build thriving societies. This course will focus on the role of the product manager in working across cross-functional teams including engineering, design, users, policy, marketing, analytics, vendors, and stakeholders when building technology products. Students will learn how to think like a product manager and how to partner with product managers. Students will learn how product managers set strategy, define products, advocate for the user, build in equity by design, experiment with prototyping, integrate ethical considerations, define metrics, utilize testing, prioritize accessibility, manage stakeholders, and understand market or policy factors in order to ship technology services and products that benefit people."
Hana Yamaki,Future issues in cyber security policy,"Each year, this class addresses a new and emerging issue in cybersecurity policy.  This semester, the topic will be Blockchain.  Rapid advances in embedded systems, ubiquitous sensors, automatic algorithms, machine learning, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence will affect security, safety, and privacy on all levels. As the current debates around national cyber-operations, Internet of Things regulation, machine learning, cell phone privacy, and bitcoin illustrate, current laws and policies are largely ill-equipped to handle our technological future. With the help of guest speakers, this seminar will explore selected aspects of these topics broadly: security issues that will arise in the future, and what regulatory, legislative, judicial, and market solutions can address them. "
Hana Yamaki,Data Analysis and Physicalization,
Hana Yamaki,Rationality,"What does it mean for behavior to be “rational”? What is the relationship among rationality, logic, consistency, proof, and emotion? These questions and others will be explored in this seminar course from the standpoint of philosophy, economics, mathematics, psychology, biology, and other disciplines. Enrollment will be limited to about 25."
Hana Yamaki,Transforming education through social entrepreneurship,"This course is designed for students who want to understand the central role that education plays in our economy and society and who may want to play an active role (e.g., as an entrepreneur, board member, etc.) in shaping the future workforce, bringing about a more equitable society, and improving the trajectories of our nation’s youth.

The cases feature social entrepreneurs leveraging entrepreneurial and managerial practices to deliver pattern-breaking change in K-12, Higher Ed, and education-focused non-profits.

Cases are set in various markets including the U.S., China, and India. Nearly all of the sessions include visits from case protagonists."
Riad El Soufi,Leadership,"Description:This course provides a diagnostic and strategic foundation for leadership practice.  Designed for professionals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, the course builds upon the extraordinary experience of many of our students. The purpose of the course is to increase one’s capacity to lead with and without authority, across boundaries, and from any political or organizational position. In a world in which most organizations, communities, and societies face enormous adaptive pressures, the practice of leadership is critical – the practice of mobilizing systems of people to thrive in changing and challenging times. In this course, we apply theory to practice, clarifying the relationship among key concepts – leadership, management, authority, power, influence, followership, citizenship – to provide a practical and coherent theoretical framework. We develop both diagnostic tools for analyzing the complexity of change in social systems, and strategies of action. These action strategies include: using authority and power wisely, mobilizing responsibility across boundaries, managing economies of attention, generating innovation, building trust, orchestrating multi-party conflict, regulating disequilibrium, refashioning narratives to both build and depart from history, and building a culture of adaptability for the long-term. In addition, we begin to explore the challenge of managing personally the inevitable stresses and dangers of leadership."
Riad El Soufi,Entrepreneurial Marketing,"You should take this course if you expect to found or join a startup, especially in a marketing, sales operations, or business development role; or if you expect to join a VC, PE or other entity (e.g., search fund) that evaluates the go-to-market activities of ventures. The course examines firms in various settings (high-tech, low-tech, professional services, retail-based, others). It builds on concepts introduced in RC Marketing and TEM, and is a complement to EC courses on sales, ecommerce, product management, and launching technology ventures.

"
Riad El Soufi,Responsive Envrionments,"The course introduces students to the tools and design methods for creating responsive environments and technologically driven experiences in the built environment. By putting the human experience at the center and forefront, from the immediate body scale to the larger environment, encompassing buildings and the urban spaces, the course examines new and emerging models and technologies for the design of innovative architectural human interfaces and technologically augmented physical environments.     The class addresses fundamental questions including: What are new and emergent ways of understanding the digital and physical environments? How can we create responsive and interactive experiences that augment the person’s experience of the physical space? What are the consequences of creating technologically augmented environments? What are the psychological, social, and environmental implications of creating such hybrids? And what are the criteria to measure successful responsive environments?  These questions of analyzing, understanding and designing responsive environments will be tackled through both class discussions and also hands-on designing and prototyping of interactive, responsive installations. Readings and discussions will explore current and historical examples, theories of phenomenology, psychogeography, multisensory experience of architecture, body-centricity, proxemics, interaction design, installation design, and human-machine interface. Informed by this discourse, the first part of the course will engage students in measuring and quantifying the ephemeral and invisible qualities of space and human experience of space. This will form the foundation for students to design spatial and interactive interventions at various scales, ranging from wearables, interactive objects, to large-scale architectural installations. In the process, students will become familiarized with technologies that can change and augment our physical environment such as biometric sensors, electronics, processing, projections, and others.The course will culminate with an exhibition of the students’ responsive and interactive installations of varied scales using the tools and methods discussed in class. The course will take advantage of the resources and the ongoing research at the Responsive Environments and Artifacts Lab."
Riad El Soufi,Extending the Museum,"Investigates the museum as a participatory public space and rethinks visitor engagement and museum education in light of digital technologies, including extended reality (XR) technologies. Students develop concepts, models, and prototypes that integrate physical and digital spaces in novel ways in close collaboration with partners at local museums. Readings provide theoretical, critical, and analytical foundations for collaborative class projects. Students taking graduate version complete additional readings and assignments."

Explores economic challenges and solutions to transforming energy markets to be more efficient, accessible, affordable, and sustainable. Applies core economic concepts - consumer choice, firm profit maximization, and strategic behavior - to understand when energy and environmental markets work well and when they fail. They also conduct data-driven economic analysis on the trade-offs of real and proposed policy interventions. Topics include renewable generation sources for electricity, energy access in emerging markets, efficiency programs and fuel efficiency standards, transitioning transportation to alternative fuels, measuring damages and adaptation to climate change, and the effect of energy and environmental policy on innovation. Expectations and evaluation criteria differ for students taking graduate version; consult syllabus or instructor for specific details."
Jae An,CS50,"Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before."
Jae An,Land Use and Envrionmental Law,"As a scarce and necessary resource, land triggers competition and conflict over its possession and use. For privately owned land, the market manages much of the competition through its familiar allocative price-setting framework. However, because one person’s use of land affects individual and collective interests of others and market mechanisms alone do not always protect or promote such interests, laws enacted by legislative bodies, administered by government agencies, and reviewed by courts have arisen to fill the gap.
    
Encompassed in local ordinances, higher-level legislation, administrative rules, discretionary government decisions, constitutions, and judicial opinions, land use laws and environmental laws significantly shape the built and natural environment. For example, zoning’s use and density restrictions affect whether neighborhoods are demographically diverse or homogeneous, its height and setback restrictions sculpt the skyline. Environmental laws govern the extent to which land uses pollute air, water, and land, whether habitat is available for endangered species, and whether wetlands are preserved. Recently enacted laws are beginning to address the impacts of climate change, determining whether and how individuals may build or rebuild in areas vulnerable to floods, severe storms, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts.
    
Through lectures, discussions, readings, and a written exercise, this course provides students with a working knowledge of land use laws and environmental laws, the institutions that create, implement, and review them, and the issues that swirl around them. The course distinguishes law’s method from those employed by other disciplines and fields. The role of non-lawyers, including urban planners, designers, public policymakers, developers, and community activists in influencing, drafting, and implementing land use and environmental laws, is explored.
    
No prior legal background is assumed. Students with a legal background have found the course instructive. For pedagogical reasons, laws employed in the United States will be the main references, but comparisons with laws in other countries will be regularly made. Reading assignments are drawn from primary sources (legislation, constitutions, judicial opinions) and secondary sources (law review and journal articles, book excerpts, professional reports). A written exercise asks students to critically examine one provision of a zoning law and draft its replacement. An oral final exam will test overall fluency with the course subject matter."
Jae An,Real Estate Finance and Development,"This course teaches the fundamentals of real estate finance and development. Lectures and case studies introduce students to the full range of financial analysis skills and analytical processes for evaluating private and public development and investment in real estate. All major property types and land uses are covered as well as all stages of the development process, including site selection, market analysis, financial feasibility, design and legal considerations, construction, lease-up, operations, and sale of the final product. The cases are designed to place students in a number of decision-making situations commonly faced by real estate professionals. Prior or supplementary study of microeconomics is useful, but not required. Students studying business, law, and government, as well as selected undergraduates will be admitted, space permitting.

Covers how to select the right market, target that market effectively, position a product or service for maximum success, and combine analytics, frameworks, and research for maximum potential. Emphasizes both marketing theory and practice: proven solutions to marketing problems, case sessions to illustrate the application of these techniques in various industries, and practice sessions to apply these techniques to real problems."
Jae An,Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"This course will explore the complex relationships between scientific advances, technological innovations, manufacturing technologies, and the development and evolution of an industry. While many students may already be familiar with scientific research and technological innovations, this course will explore how advances in science and technology impact manufacturing, industry architecture, and business. Some basic background in business management and government will be reviewed including manufacturing processes, business strategy, disruptive innovation, intellectual property, industry standards, and political economy to provide proper context for understanding the practical implications of technological innovations. We will review and investigate the basic scientific phenomena and technological innovations that underpin some major industries such as Steel, Automobiles, Semiconductors and Personal Computers. By reviewing the historical evolution of these technologies and the corresponding economic, political, legal, and sociological circumstances, we will develop a framework for understanding the strategic forces that disrupt businesses and create entrepreneurial opportunities and reshape industry structures. Working together in small groups, students will be assigned a term project to research and analyze the strategic forces that shaped other major industries such as Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Communications, and Textile/Clothing."
Jae An,Data Analysis and Physicalization,
Jae An,Nano Micro Macro,"This course is an interdisciplinary platform for designers, engineers, and scientists to interact and develop innovative new products. The course introduces ideas-to-innovation processes in a hands-on, project/product focused manner that balance design and engineering concepts with promising, real-world opportunities. Switching back and forth between guided discovery and focused development, between bottom-up and top-down thinking, and market analyses, the course helps students establish generalizable frameworks as researchers and innovators with a focus on new and emerging technologies. There are no prerequisites."
Jae An,Computational Design,"In this course, we will understand ""Computational Design"" as the set of methods borrowed from fields such as computer science, mathematics, and geometry, applied to solving design problems. Chances are that a significant portion of your typical design workflow is mediated by digital tools and, in particular, computer software that has been designed and created by a third party, and therefore, your creativity is partially biased by someone else's opinions. However, the real craftsman is the one who understands their tools so well that they can change, improve and adapt them to their own desires. In this course, you will learn how to think algorithmically, and how to understand and create computer software, so that you will be able to explore new creative opportunities and relate them to your personal interests.The course will be conducted as a mix of lectures, hands-on workshops and sections that will introduce you to the conceptual and technical foundations of Computational Design.  Coursework will be a blend of focused technical exercises and open-ended assignments, culminating in a final project of your choice at the end of the semester.Basic knowledge of Grasshopper is strongly desired although not required; if you feel you do not meet this requirement, you will be required the first week to follow a series of tutorials and complete a small exercise. Additionally, previous knowledge of computer programming is NOT required; this is part of what you will learn in this course!"
Felly Liang,Paper or Plastic,"We tend to assume that supermarkets are static, neutral spaces where little of significance ever happens. The supermarket shelf is actually a highly volatile, hyper-competitive dynamic market landscape. On this shelf, products struggle to maximize every possible advantage, all in a ruthless effort to lure consumers away from competitors. However, what may have once been merely an issue of attention-grabbing graphics applied to packaging has quickly become much more complex. The contemporary consumer in today’s strained economy demands tangible value from the products that he/she consumes. To survive, brands must wrestle with new issues that include the ergonomics of the hand, the complex geometries of the refrigerator, and even sustainable material innovations that determine a product’s afterlife and its impact on the environment. These are multi-scalar, spatial life problems that designers are uniquely suited to address.This seminar will ask students to operate as brand strategists. However, rather than invent new products, students will instead innovate upon existing brands. Outdated supermarket products will be reconsidered from the top down (brand identity, consumer target, logo, tagline, packaging, etc.). Students will also be required to study their product’s shelf competitors and will learn by presenting their observations through visual arguments rather than those that are explicitly verbal.Each seminar will open with multimedia presentations on topics such as conducting demographic research, global color psychology, brand architecture, case studies in product launch failures, creating brand touchpoints, crafting a visual argument, and making an effective pitch. These conversations will be supplemented by readings from the business and financial sections of several newspapers, magazine articles, and blog interviews with brand experts.The deliverables for the seminar will be presented in final review format in front of a cross-disciplinary jury of business luminaries. The output will include a full-scale 3-D print of the product redesign supplemented by graphical data, renderings, and digital animations. Ultimately, the seminar’s ambition is to make real a scenario that finds designers sitting at multiple tables, tackling issues of economics, technology, politics, and media at macro and micro scales."
Felly Liang,Introduction to Electrical Engineering,"The main course objectives are to introduce students to the exciting and powerful world of electrical engineering and to explain how gadgets that we use every day actually work. After taking ES 50, you will be able to leverage the power of electricity to build systems that sense, control and program the physical world around you. Examples include intelligent and autonomous systems (robots), audio amplifiers (e.g. guitar amp), interactive art installations, light-shows, mind-controlled machines, and so on."
Felly Liang,AI for Impact,"Seminar promotes internal and external entrepreneurship, based on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, to increase understanding of how digital innovations grow into societal change. Cases illustrate examples of both successful and failed businesses, as well as difficulties in deploying and diffusing products. Explores a range of business models and opportunities enabled by emerging AI innovations. Students craft a business analysis for one of the featured technology innovations. Past analyses have become the basis for research publications, and new ventures. Particular focus on AI and big data, mobile, and the use of personal data."
Felly Liang,Negotiations,"Lawyers—like all other professionals—must negotiate. Litigators resolve far more disputes through negotiation than by trial. Business lawyers, whether they are putting together a start-up company, arranging for venture financing, or preparing an initial public offering, are called upon to negotiate on behalf of their clients. Public interest lawyers, in-house counsel, government attorneys, criminal lawyers, tort lawyers, and commercial litigators all share the need to be effective negotiators. And all professionals negotiate within their own organizations for salaries, workload and roles, with constituents they represent, clients they serve, or co-founders they collaborate with. Yet few professionals have studied the negotiation process or have any systematic understanding of why negotiations often fail, the dilemmas inherent in the process, or the skills necessary to be an effective negotiator. By combining theory and practice, this Workshop aims to improve your analytical understanding of the negotiation process and your skill as a negotiator. The Workshop is designed to improve your ability to prepare for a negotiation, to engage others in joint problem-solving and decision-making, and to diagnose what is going wrong and what to do differently when negotiations break down. Above all, this Workshop will equip you to continue refining your skills as you gain more negotiation experience throughout the rest of your professional life. The Workshop is intensive and time consuming. Because any absences deprive your peers of the chance to negotiate and learn, attendance for all class sessions is mandatory. The Workshop integrates intellectual and experiential learning by combining short lectures with frequent exercises, extensive review, live and filmed examples, individual and small group reviews, and careful analysis of the negotiation process and the process of learning from experience. The Workshop is limited to 144 students who are divided into six working groups of 24 students each. The teaching team consists of six faculty members; each Working Group is taught by one faculty member and one teaching assistant. All Working Groups follow a common syllabus that has been developed collaboratively by the senior teaching team. In addition to participating in the daily activities, students will be expected to keep a weekly journal and to produce a number of short, written products throughout the term. This course has no final examination. During the first week of the Workshop, upperclass and LL.M. students will be given an opportunity to elect to take the Workshop on a credit/fail basis. We welcome cross-registrants, who enhance the richness of the experience for everyone. For cross-registrants, the availability of the credit/fail option is dependent on the policies of their home school."

Applications may include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts and the creation of scientific research tools. The course will culminate with an individual final project, integrating as many of the weekly topics as possible. Each student will document work on each weekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge that serves as a foundation for continued learning. "
Felly Liang,Interior Space Thinking,"A large part of the experience of Architecture is in the Interior.  True in residential, public, hospitality, and workplace spaces, the functioning Interior can define the very purpose of the building. The objective of this course is to design a residential, workplace, and hospitality interior in the context of cultural, corporate, and individual/group expectations, work, living, and “play” for a specific client.  Students will be broken up into one of three collaborative teams to design one building type per group, with a principal focus of the interior space.  Renderings, models, material boards and other client appropriate presentation methods will be required to elaborate the projects.We will discuss the issues of Interior Architecture as related to the building considering sub-architecture, exteriors, furnishings, objects, technology, UX, and materiality.  Each project brief should be defined by client need and reinforced by the above design criteria. The course objective for each team will be to define a clear interior brief and execute it in the context of collaborative teamwork, professional practice, and the goals of the client. Evaluation will be based not only on the interior space design, but exemplary communication of three-dimensional ideas to two dimensional clients."
Felly Liang,Data and Information Visualization,"This course focuses on building creative and technical skills to transform data into visual reports for the purpose of engendering a shared understanding. Students will learn to use software to ingest, organize, and visualize data, with an emphasis on applying design principles to produce clear, elegant graphs and dashboards that capture the essence of an insight, message, or recommendation distilled from the data.

Students will become familiar with exploratory and explanatory data visualization techniques for data storytelling.  Additionally, students will work together on team projects to develop their creative and technical skills as well as to learn from their peers.  We will be using data from real world sources and applications for our in-class exercises and group projects."
Felly Liang,Behavioral Science and Urban Mobility,"Examines the behavioral foundation for policy design using urban transportation examples. Introduces multiple frameworks for understanding behavior while contrasting the perspectives of classic economic theory with behavioral economics and social psychology. Suggests corresponding policy interventions and establishes a mapping across behavior, theory, and policy. Presents a spectrum of instruments for positively influencing behavior and improving welfare. Challenges students to critique, design, implement and interpret experiments that nudge travel behavior. Brings behavioral insights to creative design of transport policies that are efficient and equitable as well as simple, consistent, transparent, acceptable, and adaptive to behavioral changes. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments."
Rebecca Brand,Visualization,"An introduction to key design principles and techniques for visualizing data. Covers design practices, data and image models, visual perception, interaction principles, visualization tools, and applications. Introduces programming of web-based interactive visualizations."
Rebecca Brand,Elements of the Urban Stack,"The Urban Stack is a pedagogical framework for understanding the infrastructures of power that operate in relationship to practice. These constructs shape the design and production of the built environment in our time of increasing uncertainty, project complexity, and risk. The course is designed to explore, translate and generate alternative readings of our built context; to imagine how design and planning practice can shape the environmental, social, cultural, and experiential qualities of urban form within our emerging 21st century context. A primary objective of the course is to identify gaps and opportunities in the layered socio-technical systems that guide the production of the built environment; to enable culturally and socially transformative development with the goal of practical application in the real world.This course addresses the practice of design as it inevitably confronts and interacts with infrastructures of policy, technology, and finance. Theoretical frameworks will help us seek space for design impact and agency through established and emerging modes of practice and projects that operate upon, within, or against these systemic constructs. Our task is to collectively answer the following questions: As urban projects grow in complexity, swelling and speeding up to attain maximum impact, is our work inevitably defined and shaped by the pressures of finance, automation, and regulation? Where does our agency as designers of the built environment lie in current practice?"

Luke Reeve,City Use of Technology,This three-credit course surveys the efforts of city officials around the world as they use technology to solve challenging problems and act to both keep pace with technological innovations and safeguard the public interest. This survey course is designed to equip students with an overview of tools they will need to grapple with urban and civic challenges post-graduation. Students will examine and report on ongoing civic projects.
Daniel Feist,Building and Urban Conservation,"What are the values inherent in a property, site or district that must be understood to craft conservation policy and interventions that will reveal, complement, sustain and enhance the original work while appropriately addressing socio-cultural, aesthetic and technical integrity?  This course will introduce students to the functional, technical, regulatory and environmental principles of working with existing buildings and districts to ensure their continued viability.   Globally, 35% or more of construction activity is devoted to work on existing structures – making the sustainability mantra “the greenest building is the one already built” increasingly relevant as we seek to minimize the impact of construction on the environment. Repair and renewal are therefore fundamental components of contemporary practice increasingly requiring facility in techniques of conservation planning and execution, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse.  Designed to ground the participant in the methodologies of conservation and renewal and to introduce the tools necessary to successfully approach working with existing buildings in established precincts, the course will include lectures by the instructor and guest experts, and in-class discussions from readings.  While interventions must include sound technical solutions, any modification from conservation to renovation and additions must address the full complement of values necessary to enable an economically viable, socio-culturally relevant rehabilitation. We will examine a range of conservation and intervention case studies at the building and urban scale for both traditional and modern structures and sites – including a mini-module on the impending renovations to Gund Hall.We will look critically at how the international Charters and Standards employed in working with historic fabric impact our approach to modifications to any existing building or site from a technical, design and regulatory standpoint, and will particularly address the question as to how the apparatus of conservation is changing to best serve both underrepresented constituencies and the legacy of modernism and the recent past.The course is a lecture and discussion-based seminar.  Evaluation will be based upon participation in readings and themed discussion, submission of a short analytical mid-term paper, and a choice of final project: either 1., an assessment and intervention design exercise on an undeveloped modest property, or 2., an analytical case study of the rehabilitation and transformation of a significant property – either of the student’s choosing."
Daniel Feist,Field Y,"The course is designed to enable students to develop and grow their businesses. Doing so while on campus has several advantages, including access to resources (faculty time and attention, library and computer access); advice from your peers in a structured environment; and devoted blocks of time during your EC year to move your business forward while your team is all in one location. The course employs a combination of field methods, classroom exercises, cross-team interactions, and access to faculty, guest experts, and other advisors. The largest single allocation of time is for working with your team to make meaningful progress on your own business.

Several dozen teams from last year are running their businesses full-time now, most of whom have received funding of $500,000 or more; in some cases far more."
Daniel Feist,Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"This course will explore the complex relationships between scientific advances, technological innovations, manufacturing technologies, and the development and evolution of an industry. While many students may already be familiar with scientific research and technological innovations, this course will explore how advances in science and technology impact manufacturing, industry architecture, and business. Some basic background in business management and government will be reviewed including manufacturing processes, business strategy, disruptive innovation, intellectual property, industry standards, and political economy to provide proper context for understanding the practical implications of technological innovations. We will review and investigate the basic scientific phenomena and technological innovations that underpin some major industries such as Steel, Automobiles, Semiconductors and Personal Computers. By reviewing the historical evolution of these technologies and the corresponding economic, political, legal, and sociological circumstances, we will develop a framework for understanding the strategic forces that disrupt businesses and create entrepreneurial opportunities and reshape industry structures. Working together in small groups, students will be assigned a term project to research and analyze the strategic forces that shaped other major industries such as Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Communications, and Textile/Clothing."
Daniel Feist,Drawing for Designers,"The course is intended as a creative drawing laboratory for designers and an expressive, playful supplement to computer-based labor.This course will master techniques in hand drawing, refining sensitivity to all details of what one sees and developing capacity to articulate it in a visually convincing and evocative form.The class projects will include work in outdoor and indoor situations and places as well as drawings of live models. In the process of drawing, students will focus on the world of lines, textures, shapes, light, shade, and values. We will use various tools, materials, and artistic techniques including pencils, vine charcoal, markers, ink, and other wet and dry media, later combined with the use of camera, computer renderings, etc.Throughout the duration of the course, students will complete three larger drawing projects and special short assignments.In one nonrepresentational drawing project, students will focus on the formal articulation of emotional life experience. In another project, we will explore the performance of the human body in interaction with elements of the architectural environment. In a final project, the drawing exploration of the bodily interaction with the architectural environment as well as the site-specific wall drawing exercise will be conducted in the interior places inspired by and creatively responding to the existential and spatial conditions imposed by the quarantine and the epidemics.In addition, students will make individual self-guided field trips to sketch and draw in the outdoor environment and then complete their work in the places they live.Work on projects will be supplemented by presentations and discussions of relevant examples from art history and contemporary art. Guest artists will be invited as reviewers for the presentation and exhibition of final projects."
Arthur van Havre,Science of Behavior Change                                                                                        ,"Psychologists and economists have joined forces to study how people process information and actually make decisions, rather than how they would make decisions if they were fully rational and selfish.  This research program (behavioral economics, judgment and decision making, or behavioral science) shows how decisions deviate from “optimal” and why it matters.  We explore the nature, causes, implications and applications of these limitations.  The course’s main focus is on how these tendencies can inform the design and development of welfare-enhancing interventions.The Science of Behavior Change (MLD 304) has one central objective: to improve students’ abilities to design policies and interventions that improve societal well-being.  It accomplishes this by focusing on how to leverage insights about human decision making to develop interventions (“nudges”).  We piece add to the toolbox that standard economics provides for influencing behavior (namely, incentives and information) with the insights from behavioral science. There are three additional, though secondary, goals for this class.  First, it will help you better understand the science of how humans make judgments and decisions.  We will review research on human thinking from social psychology, cognitive psychology, political science, organizational behavior, decision science, and economics (including its subfield, behavioral economics). Second, this course aims to improve the quality of your own judgments and decisions.  People are poor intuitive statisticians, meaning that when they “just think” about situations for which some data or casual observations exist, they tend to make serious inferential errors, in turn leading to systematically biased decisions. We will study some errors that are particularly important for real world problems and look for easy‐to‐implement solutions. Third, this course aims to increase your familiarity with randomized experiments so you can be a smarter consumer of claims that interventions cause certain outcomes.  The class will be suffused with randomized experiments and we will repeatedly discuss how confident one can be that intervention X causes outcome Y. Applications of the material covered in this course include policy design, healthcare, diversity and inclusion, energy, politics, education, finance, negotiation, risk management, human resource management, and organization of teams, among others."
Arthur van Havre,Authenticity MIT Prison Initiative,"Explores the question of how to live an authentic life, through works of western and eastern philosophy and contemporary psychology. Topics include emotions, anger, honesty, forgiveness, non-violent communication, conflict resolution, kindness and cruelty and compassion. Taught inside a secure Massachusetts correctional facility with a mix of MIT students and incarcerated students."
Arthur van Havre,Making the American City,"This course examines major episodes in the history of American urban growth, design, and planning to understand the urgent social, environmental, and development issues of today.  It traces the growth and elaboration of North American cities in four major periods of urban history from the early European settlement to the present, with an emphasis on the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Through the study of plans, physical projects, and material conditions, Making the American City investigates specific topics, such as the downtown; homes and housing; public parks and landscapes; planned communities and civic spaces; homes and housing; transportation systems; environmental threats and disasters; the provision of infrastructure; racial and ethnic settlement patterns; slums and ghettos; bohemias and art districts; urban renewal and revitalization; gentrification; public landscapes and spaces; and suburbia in all its diversity.The objective of the course is to use history to inform the thinking and practice of contemporary designers, planners, and policy makers. Students enrolled in the course will gain a fundamental knowledge of the major events that have contributed to the form and character of modern American cities. The format of the course will be lectures and class discussions. The method of evaluation will be short student papers on projects or subjects chosen from different periods of the history of the American city.  There are no prerequisites."
Steven Morse,Science of Behavior Change                                                                                        ,"Psychologists and economists have joined forces to study how people process information and actually make decisions, rather than how they would make decisions if they were fully rational and selfish.  This research program (behavioral economics, judgment and decision making, or behavioral science) shows how decisions deviate from “optimal” and why it matters.  We explore the nature, causes, implications and applications of these limitations.  The course’s main focus is on how these tendencies can inform the design and development of welfare-enhancing interventions.The Science of Behavior Change (MLD 304) has one central objective: to improve students’ abilities to design policies and interventions that improve societal well-being.  It accomplishes this by focusing on how to leverage insights about human decision making to develop interventions (“nudges”).  We piece add to the toolbox that standard economics provides for influencing behavior (namely, incentives and information) with the insights from behavioral science. There are three additional, though secondary, goals for this class.  First, it will help you better understand the science of how humans make judgments and decisions.

There are no prerequisites."
Jiwon Woo,Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"This course will explore the complex relationships between scientific advances, technological innovations, manufacturing technologies, and the development and evolution of an industry. While many students may already be familiar with scientific research and technological innovations, this course will explore how advances in science and technology impact manufacturing, industry architecture, and business. Some basic background in business management and government will be reviewed including manufacturing processes, business strategy, disruptive innovation, intellectual property, industry standards, and political economy to provide proper context for understanding the practical implications of technological innovations. We will review and investigate the basic scientific phenomena and technological innovations that underpin some major industries such as Steel, Automobiles, Semiconductors and Personal Computers. By reviewing the historical evolution of these technologies and the corresponding economic, political, legal, and sociological circumstances, we will develop a framework for understanding the strategic forces that disrupt businesses and create entrepreneurial opportunities and reshape industry structures. Working together in small groups, students will be assigned a term project to research and analyze the strategic forces that shaped other major industries such as Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Communications, and Textile/Clothing."
Jade Wu,Drawing for Designers,"The course is intended as a creative drawing laboratory for designers and an expressive, playful supplement to computer-based labor.This course will master techniques in hand drawing, refining sensitivity to all details of what one sees and developing capacity to articulate it in a visually convincing and evocative form.The class projects will include work in outdoor and indoor situations and places as well as drawings of live models. In the process of drawing, students will focus on the world of lines, textures, shapes, light, shade, and values. We will use various tools, materials, and artistic techniques including pencils, vine charcoal, markers, ink, and other wet and dry media, later combined with the use of camera, computer renderings, etc.Throughout the duration of the course, students will complete three larger drawing projects and special short assignments.In one nonrepresentational drawing project, students will focus on the formal articulation of emotional life experience. In another project, we will explore the performance of the human body in interaction with elements of the architectural environment. In a final project, the drawing exploration of the bodily interaction with the architectural environment as well as the site-specific wall drawing exercise will be conducted in the interior places inspired by and creatively responding to the existential and spatial conditions imposed by the quarantine and the epidemics.In addition, students will make individual self-guided field trips to sketch and draw in the outdoor environment and then complete their work in the places they live.Work on projects will be supplemented by presentations and discussions of relevant examples from art history and contemporary art. Guest artists will be invited as reviewers for the presentation and exhibition of final projects."

Jon Chinen,Introduction to Data Science ,"Data Science 1 is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year."
Jon Chinen,Elements of the Urban Stack,"The Urban Stack is a pedagogical framework for understanding the infrastructures of power that operate in relationship to practice. These constructs shape the design and production of the built environment in our time of increasing uncertainty, project complexity, and risk. The course is designed to explore, translate and generate alternative readings of our built context; to imagine how design and planning practice can shape the environmental, social, cultural, and experiential qualities of urban form within our emerging 21st century context. A primary objective of the course is to identify gaps and opportunities in the layered socio-technical systems that guide the production of the built environment; to enable culturally and socially transformative development with the goal of practical application in the real world.This course addresses the practice of design as it inevitably confronts and interacts with infrastructures of policy, technology, and finance. Theoretical frameworks will help us seek space for design impact and agency through established and emerging modes of practice and projects that operate upon, within, or against these systemic constructs. Our task is to collectively answer the following questions: As urban projects grow in complexity, swelling and speeding up to attain maximum impact, is our work inevitably defined and shaped by the pressures of finance, automation, and regulation? Where does our agency as designers of the built environment lie in current practice?"
Jon Chinen,Abstraction and Design in Computation,"Fundamental concepts in the design of computer programs, emphasizing the crucial role of abstraction. The goal of the course is to give students insight into the difference between programming and programming well. To emphasize the differing approaches to expressing programming solutions, you will learn to program in a variety of paradigms -- including functional, imperative, and object-oriented. Important ideas from software engineering and models of computation will inform these different views of programming."
